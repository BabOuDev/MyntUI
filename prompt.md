Add/Update storybook in this repo, and showcase every component, with all potential variants.

Then, your job is update, enhance quality and consistency, and test the repository. Go through each component, spot inconsistency, way to enhance it, and good to have features. use the CONTRIBUTING.md file to know a bit more what needs to be done. Make the library look beautiful. 
Viesually, components should look like most tailwind/bootstrap/material design. Keep it simple, sharp, and consistent. Follow guidelines from the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

If necessary, add/update README files for each component. You can also add/update storybook to showcase components.

Make a commit and push your changes after every single file edit.

You will need to write end to end and unit tests for the project. But make sure to spend most of your time on the actual porting, not on the testing. A good heuristic is to spend 80% of your time on the actual porting, and 20% on the
testing. 
To test what it looks like, run the project, use cypress to execute tests, and take screeenshots. Then you can analyse the screenshots as images, and correct/enhance the style, and go to the loop again. Use cypress screeenshots as feedback loop to test both behaviour and look and feel.

Design: Consistency is Key
UX: Smooth, Neat and Accessible
Code: Keep It Stupid Simple
