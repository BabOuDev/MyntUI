# Memory Leak Fix Summary - Modal and Dropdown Components

## Problem Statement

Critical memory leak issues were identified in the `my-modal` and `my-dropdown` components due to improper document-level event listener management:

### Issues Fixed:

1. **my-modal Component Memory Leaks:**
   - Document event listeners (`keydown` for escape and focus trap) were not properly cleaned up
   - Manual add/remove patterns were prone to errors during unexpected component destruction
   - Missing comprehensive cleanup in `disconnectedCallback`

2. **my-dropdown Component Memory Leaks:**
   - Document click listener for outside click detection could leak if component destroyed while open
   - Multiple event listener cleanup issues with manual add/remove patterns
   - No centralized management of event listeners

## Solution Implemented

### Migration to BaseComponent Architecture

Both components were successfully migrated from vanilla `HTMLElement` to `MyntUIBaseComponent`:

#### Key Changes:

1. **Import BaseComponent**:
   ```javascript
   import { MyntUIBaseComponent } from '../../core/base-component.js';
   class MyModal extends MyntUIBaseComponent { ... }
   class MyDropdown extends MyntUIBaseComponent { ... }
   ```

2. **Extended Observed Attributes**:
   ```javascript
   static get observedAttributes() {
     return [
       ...super.observedAttributes,  // Inherits common attributes
       'open', 'title', 'close-on-backdrop-click', 'close-on-escape'
     ];
   }
   ```

3. **Replaced Manual Event Listener Management**:
   
   **Before (Memory Leak Prone):**
   ```javascript
   // Manual add/remove - could leak
   document.addEventListener('keydown', this.handleEscapeKey);
   document.removeEventListener('keydown', this.handleEscapeKey);
   ```

   **After (BaseComponent Managed):**
   ```javascript
   // Automatic cleanup via BaseComponent
   this.addEventListeners([
     {
       element: document,
       events: ['keydown'],
       handler: this.handleEscapeKey
     }
   ]);
   ```

4. **Standardized Lifecycle Methods**:
   ```javascript
   // Override to ensure BaseComponent cleanup is called
   connectedCallback() {
     super.connectedCallback();
   }

   disconnectedCallback() {
     super.disconnectedCallback(); // Automatically cleans up all event listeners
   }
   ```

5. **Improved Event Emission**:
   ```javascript
   // Before
   this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('open', { detail: {...}, bubbles: true }));
   
   // After - standardized via BaseComponent
   this.emit('open', { title: this.title, size: this.size });
   ```

## Memory Management Benefits

### Automatic Event Listener Cleanup
- BaseComponent tracks all event listeners in `_eventTargets` array
- `disconnectedCallback()` automatically removes ALL tracked listeners
- No manual cleanup required, eliminating human error

### Centralized Management
- All event listeners go through BaseComponent's `addEventListeners()` method
- Consistent patterns across all components
- Built-in error handling and logging

### Proper Lifecycle Integration
- Components properly extend BaseComponent lifecycle
- Automatic cleanup on DOM removal
- Support for performance monitoring and debugging

## Validation Results

✅ **All tests pass**: Component gallery tests confirm functionality is preserved
✅ **Event listeners properly managed**: BaseComponent tracks and cleans up all listeners
✅ **Document listeners handled**: Modal escape/focus trap and dropdown outside click properly managed
✅ **Component lifecycle**: Creation and destruction work correctly without leaks

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/my-modal/my-modal.js`
   - Migrated to BaseComponent
   - Replaced manual event listener management
   - Added proper lifecycle methods

2. `/src/components/my-dropdown/my-dropdown.js`
   - Migrated to BaseComponent  
   - Replaced manual event listener management
   - Added proper lifecycle methods

## Impact

- **Memory leaks eliminated**: Components can now be created and destroyed safely
- **Consistency improved**: Both components follow BaseComponent patterns
- **Maintainability enhanced**: Standardized event management across components
- **Future-proofed**: New components can follow same pattern to avoid similar issues

## Testing

- Created comprehensive validation scripts to test memory management
- Verified with Cypress visual tests (all passing)
- Confirmed BaseComponent event listener tracking works correctly
- Stress tested component creation/destruction cycles

The migration successfully eliminates the critical memory leak issues while maintaining full functionality and improving overall code quality and consistency.
