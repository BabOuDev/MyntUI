  - xs: 12px (down from 16px) - for compact UI elements
  - sm: 16px (down from 20px) - for standard interfaces
  - md: 20px (down from 24px) - for regular usage
  - Improved size differentiation and Material Design 3 compliance

#### Button Component (my-button)
- **FAB Border Radius**: Changed from 16px to 12px for better Material Design 3 compliance
- **Visual Balance**: Improved consistency between regular buttons and floating action buttons

#### Toggle Component (my-toggle)
- **New Size Variant**: Added xs size variant (36px width, 12px track height)
- **Granular Options**: More size options for different use cases
- **Proportional Scaling**: Maintained proper scaling for all interaction states

#### Input Component (my-input)
- **Border Radius Optimization**: Medium size uses 4px instead of 8px radius
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Better size differentiation between variants
- **Material Design 3 Compliance**: More consistent with form component guidelines

#### Checkbox Component (my-checkbox)
- **Border Radius Enhancement**: Increased from 2px to 4px
- **Visual Consistency**: Better alignment with other form components
- **Modern Aesthetic**: Slightly more rounded corners for contemporary feel
