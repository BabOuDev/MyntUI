- **ARIA Support**: Comprehensive ARIA attributes and live regions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enhanced keyboard interaction patterns
- **Screen Reader Support**: Better announcements and semantic markup

## ðŸ›  Technical Architecture

### **Component Structure**
- All components extend `MyntUIBaseComponent` for consistency
- Shadow DOM encapsulation for style isolation
- Native web standards (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, EventTarget)
- Framework-agnostic implementation

### **Design System**
- Two-level CSS variable system (global semantic â†’ component-specific)
- Consistent naming conventions following US English
- Comprehensive design tokens for spacing, colors, typography, and motion
- Material Design 3 alignment with modern web standards

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Visual Testing**: Cypress E2E tests with screenshot comparison
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive component behavior testing
- **Integration Testing**: Real browser testing with user interaction simulation
- **Accessibility Testing**: ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation testing

## ðŸ“Š Metrics and Results

### **Test Coverage**
- **Visual Tests**: 10/10 passing (100%)
- **Component Coverage**: All major components showcased and tested
- **Responsive Testing**: Mobile, tablet, desktop viewports verified
- **New Unit Tests**: 3 comprehensive test suites added (125+ test cases)

### **Component Showcase**
- **Button Variants**: 9+ variants with complete state coverage
- **Input Types**: 6+ input types with validation and accessibility
- **Data Visualization**: 3 chart types with interactive features
